----------------------------------------------------
### I have here all pattern for useful and more productive development. I've done it for some reason:
* There is no really full book for describing patterns. Some of them have boring UML, some of them were written on Smaltalk, etc.
* Particularly i have not seen good realization on php.
* I'd liked to describe  more patterns, with more examples and more descriptions.

# Write code and love php, X

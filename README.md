# Design-pattern
Pattern by Zandstra, Domnikl, Borisov and Sydorenko.
I have here all pattern for useful and more productive development. I've done it for some reason:
1. There is no really full book for describing patterns. Some of them have boring UML, some of them were written on Smaltalk, etc.
2. Particularly i have not seen good realization on php.
3. I'd liked to describe  more patterns, with more examples and more descriptions.
Write code and love php, X
